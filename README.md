# easy-esc-stm32f103-mt6701-ncp81155
small, closed loop simpleFOC driver board, that can be assembled for &lt;$10 with mostly basic components at LCSC. has support for current sensing and mounting WS2812 RGBLED for indicating, as well as USB C for serial communication and programming. SWD + UART via STLINK 14 pin conector.

The targe for this project was to create an all-in-one simpleFOC board with high resolution magnetic encoder, current sensing, simpleFOC BLDC driver board which can be assembled with top-side only components, 2 layers, mostly basic components from LCSC library, and which can be powered entirely from USB 2.0 specification (500mA) for mostly use with haptic texture type applications. Additionally, it has a compact size of 38x38mm.
